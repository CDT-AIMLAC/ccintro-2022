# Effective Team Working

-

## Why are we doing this?

* Gain experience of 
  * Remote working and collaboration
  * Applying machine learning/big data to real(ish) problems
  * Technical skills
    * Programming
    * Data processing
    * Machine learning
    * Cloud computing
  * Software engineering
    * Version control
    * Testing/Continuous Integration
* Something to show/talk about to prospective employers
* Prepare you for your placements

-

## What you'll be doing

* Project running through your first year
  * Presented at this event next year
* A few hours per week of work
* Regular meeting with a "customer"
* Help sessions with RSEs

-

## Introductions

* Within your tables:
  * Name
  * PhD topic
  * What were you doing this time last year?

-

## Scenario

* You are a small software team specialising in bespoke machine learning products
* You've been hired by an (imaginary) customer
* They are investigating automating business decisions with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and/or Advanced computing
* They've previously commissioned some work, but need to move to a new supplier for maintenance and additional features

-

## What makes teams challenging?

* What difficulties can you see with delivering software as a small team, responding to customer needs?
* Discuss in tables
* Write thoughts down
* 10 minutes

-

## How even can teams?

* Can you imagine some ways of working that might resolve these problems?
* Discuss in your teams
* Agree a series of short bullet points (max 7) describing the process you might use

## Planning

* Specification:
  * Make the customer a cup of coffee
    * 1 milk
    * 3 sugar

  * How could the tasks be distributed between team members?

## A sample process

<style type="text/css">
  .reveal ol {
    display: block;
    padding-left: 10%;
  }
</style>

<div id="left" data-markdown>

1. **Meet the customer**
2. Hold a planning meeting
  * Agree tasks
  * Add tasks to your task list as "waiting"
  * Estimate and note task length (S/M/L)
  * Reflect on the last iteration
3. Choose a task (waiting or review)
4. Self-assign the task
5. If "waiting" then move task to "active"
6. Complete the task
7. Move the task onwards

</div>

<div id="right" data-markdown>

* Loop steps 3&ndash;7
* **Meet with your technical contact**
* Have a "daily standup" at agreed intervals
* Call each iteration of this a "sprint"

</div>

-

## Standup

* Three questions:
  * What have you achieved since last standup?
  * What will you work on for next standup?
  * What issues might you anticipate?

-

## Process development

* The ideal process is different for every team and organisation
* Make looking critically at your process and developing it part of your process
